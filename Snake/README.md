Play the classic Snake programmed with Python and the PyGame library.

The 'Source Code.py' needs the 'Resources' folder to work properly. 

The 'Snake.exe' file also needs to be executed with the 'Resources' folder in the same directory.

If you want another value for the speed variable, you can change it in the file 'speed.txt' inside folder 'Resources'
